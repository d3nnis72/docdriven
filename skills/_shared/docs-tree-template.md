Human docs are short orientation and day-one operation. The base human docs are
defaults, not a closed contract. Adaptive human docs are generated or created
only when project evidence shows a distinct human need. The names above are
common examples; a project may need different files or fewer files.

Agent docs are protocol and routing.
`manifest.json` points to route shards. Route shards are the machine-readable
contract. `context-map.md` is the readable route view. Knowledge docs are the
canonical explanation of current truth. Tmp docs are temporary and not truth.

Before treating the scaffold as complete:

- remove or avoid docs for absent concepts
- add docs for real setup, operational, domain, or interface needs
- split docs only when it improves navigation or ownership
- record uncertain docs work in `agent/gaps.md`

Architecture docs are adaptive. The default `knowledge/architecture/README.md`
should explain the actual project structure, structural ownership, dependency
direction, configuration flow, and durable coding patterns. It must not force a
generic folder layout. It should tell agents where authoritative code contracts
live and when a new folder, doc, or route is justified.
